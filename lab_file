Concept used:
Connect the led with the help of switch, bread board,arduino board.aAter connecting these write the code and stimulate it .if the code is write then it stimulates.

Learning and outcomes:
If the lux<300 then the led glows brighter
If the lux>300 then the led glows 50% of the initial condition

Precautions:
Check the port before uploading the code as this is common mistake for all.

PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
No problem faced while performing the experiment. Worked well, as the task was an easy one.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
After performing this experiment, I am comfortable with the basic hardware and software aspects of Arduino.
